Hi, I am Santosh, hailing from Kukanoor in Karnataka. 
I completed my postgraduate course, Master of Computer Application (MCA), at VTU University, graduating in 2015. 
I was selected as a Software Trainee at Aliment Software Ltd., where I worked for over 2 years.

During my tenure, I had the opportunity to work on various technologies such as ASP.NET, C#, SQL, and MVC. 
I also provided support for existing VB.Net applications. 
Subsequently, in 2018, I joined HGS Company and have been working there for more than 5 years.

At HGS, I have worked on a diverse range of technologies, including ASP.NET, C#, SQL, MVC, and ASP.NET Core. 
Additionally, I have continued to offer support for existing VB.Net applications. 
After spending over 5 years with the same company, I am now seeking new challenges and opportunities.

That's a brief overview of my professional journey.


******** 1)Difference between System.datetime and System.Datetime.Now in C#?
System.datetime									|	System.Datetime.Now
1)If you need to work with a specific date 		|	1)If you want to get the current date and time, 
  and time, you use the System.DateTime type.	|	  you use the System.DateTime.Now property.


2) What is Globalization and Localization?
In ASP.NET Core, Globalization and Localization are concepts that deal with adapting applications to different cultures and languages.

1. **Globalization:**
- **Definition:** 
Globalization is the process of designing and developing applications that can work with different cultures and regions. 
It involves making your application aware of cultural differences such as date and time formats, number formats, 
and text direction.

- **Implementation in ASP.NET Core:** ASP.NET Core provides a mechanism for globalizing applications through the use of the 
`IStringLocalizer` interface. This interface allows you to retrieve localized strings based on the current culture. 
You can use resource files or databases to store localized content, 
and the framework will automatically select the appropriate resource based on the user's culture.

2. **Localization:**
   - **Definition:** Localization is the process of adapting an application to a specific language and culture. It involves translating the user interface, messages, and other content into different languages to make the application accessible and user-friendly for people from various linguistic backgrounds.
   - **Implementation in ASP.NET Core:** ASP.NET Core supports localization through resource files and the `IStringLocalizer` interface. Resource files contain key-value pairs where keys represent the original content in a default language, and values are the translated content for different languages. The framework handles the selection of the appropriate resource file based on the user's culture.

Here's a basic overview of how you might use localization in ASP.NET Core:

- Create resource files for each supported language.
- Use the `IStringLocalizer` interface to retrieve localized strings in your application code.
- Set the application's culture based on user preferences or browser settings.

By implementing globalization and localization, ASP.NET Core applications can provide a more inclusive and user-friendly experience for users around the world, supporting different languages, date formats, and other cultural preferences.

Q: What are the helpers in ASP.NET Core? and it's types explain with example
Ans :
In ASP.NET Core, helpers are utility methods and classes that simplify common tasks in view files (Razor views). 
They help generate HTML markup and perform various other operations. 
There are different types of helpers in ASP.NET Core. Here are some common types:

1. **HTML Helpers:**
   - HTML Helpers simplify the process of generating HTML elements in Razor views.
   - They are methods that generate HTML markup for standard elements like input controls, links, and form elements.

   Example - Generating a hyperlink:
   ```csharp
   @Html.ActionLink("Click me", "ActionName", "ControllerName")
   ```

2. **Tag Helpers:**
   - Tag Helpers are a more HTML-centric way of writing server-side code in Razor views.
   - They use HTML-like syntax to perform server-side operations.

   Example - Form Tag Helper:
   ```html
   <form asp-controller="HomeController" asp-action="SubmitForm" method="post">
       <!-- form content here -->
   </form>
   ```

3. **View Components:**
   - View Components are similar to partial views but are more powerful.
   - They can include both server-side and client-side code and are used for rendering reusable components.

   Example - Creating a View Component:
   ```csharp
   public class MyViewComponent : ViewComponent
   {
       public IViewComponentResult Invoke()
       {
           // Logic here
           return View();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **ViewBag and ViewData:**
   - ViewBag and ViewData are dynamic objects that allow you to pass data from controllers to views.
   - They are not specific to ASP.NET Core, but they are commonly used to share data between controller actions and views.

   Example - Setting data in controller:
   ```csharp
   ViewBag.Message = "Hello, world!";
   ```

   Example - Retrieving data in a view:
   ```csharp
   <p>@ViewBag.Message</p>
   ```

5. **Url Helpers:**
   - Url Helpers help generate URLs in a type-safe manner.
   - They assist in creating links to controller actions.

   Example - Generating a URL in Razor view:
   ```csharp
   <a href="@Url.Action("ActionName", "ControllerName")">Click me</a>
   ```

These are just a few examples of helpers in ASP.NET Core. 
They are designed to enhance the developer's productivity by providing convenient ways to perform common tasks in Razor views. 
Depending on your needs, you may choose to use different types of helpers in your ASP.NET Core applications.
